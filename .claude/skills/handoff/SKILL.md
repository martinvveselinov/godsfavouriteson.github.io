  Produce a structured HANDOFF.md and hand remaining work to fresh-context

  handoff", "checkpoint", or "split this across fresh agents". Captures Goal /

  starts with a clean context window briefed by the handoff document.

# Handoff

When a long task has eaten most of the context window, the cheapest way to keep quality high
is **not** to push on with a crowded context — it is to write down the state precisely and
restart the remaining work in fresh contexts. This skill does exactly that: it writes a
durable `HANDOFF.md`, then delegates each remaining subtask to a brand-new subagent that
reads the handoff as its briefing.

This is execution discipline, not a capability boost. A fresh subagent reasons better on a
clean context than a crowded one reasons on a full one — but only if the handoff document is
genuinely self-contained. A vague handoff just moves the confusion downstream.

## When to trigger

Run this skill when **either** holds:

- **Context pressure** — roughly 60%+ of the context window is used and there is still
  multi-step work remaining. Don't wait for a hard compaction; a deliberate handoff beats an
  emergency one.
- **Explicit request** — the user asks to hand off, checkpoint, write a HANDOFF.md, or split
  the rest across fresh agents.

## When NOT to trigger

- The task is nearly done and finishing it costs less than writing a handoff. Just finish.
- The remaining work is a single trivial step. Do it directly.
- Context is comfortable and the work is coherent in one head. Handing off mid-thought
  fractures a single idea across agents for no gain.

## Execution discipline (smith-mode)

This is a multi-step, multi-agent task, so follow `.claude/skills/smith-mode/SKILL.md`:
write a numbered stage map first, delegate independent subtasks to subagents, verify each
stage with a check that can actually fail, and self-critique before delivery. The stages
below ARE that map.

---

## Stage 1 — Take inventory (before writing anything)

Reconstruct ground truth from artifacts, not memory:

- `git status` and `git branch --show-current` — what is uncommitted, what branch.
- `git log --oneline -10` — what landed already.
- `gh pr list --head <branch>` (best-effort) — any open PR for this work.
- The original task / ticket and any plan file (e.g. `stuff/plans/*.md`) — the intended end
  state and the verification commands the project actually uses.

Expected output: a clear list of what is done, what is in flight, and what is still open —
each open item phrased as a **discrete, independently-actionable subtask** (one a fresh agent
could pick up cold).

## Stage 2 — Write `HANDOFF.md`

Write `HANDOFF.md` at the repo root (or update it in place if one already exists). It MUST
contain these sections, in this order, each filled with specifics — file paths, command
strings, branch names, not vibes:

```markdown
# HANDOFF — <short task name>

## Goal
What success looks like, end to end. The done criteria.

## Current state
Where things stand right now: branch, build/test status, what is mid-edit.

## Branches & PRs
Active branch, base branch, any open PR URL, CI status.

## Done
Completed, verified work — each item with the evidence (a passing test, a merged commit).

## In-progress
Work started but not finished, and exactly where it was left (file + line, or "edit half
applied"). Flag anything that could be in a broken intermediate state.

## Next steps
The remaining work as a NUMBERED list of discrete, independently-actionable subtasks. Each
subtask names its files, its acceptance check, and whether it edits files (needs a worktree)
or is read-only. Order them; note dependencies between them explicitly.

## Verification commands
The exact commands that prove the work is correct (build, typecheck, test, lint, any project
gate). Copy them verbatim from the project — do not invent.

## Risks & guardrails
Known traps, things not to touch, conventions to honor (Conventional Commits, no
Co-Authored-By trailers, additive-only, "keep the gate green", etc.), and any place a
subagent could plausibly go wrong.
```

**Failable check:** re-read `HANDOFF.md` and confirm every section is present and the
"Next steps" items are each independently actionable (a fresh agent could start one without
asking you a question). If any section is empty or hand-wavy, fix it before delegating — a
weak handoff is the failure mode this skill exists to prevent.

## Stage 3 — Delegate one fresh subagent per remaining subtask

For **each** subtask in "Next steps", spawn **one** subagent via the **Agent** tool. Do not
batch unrelated subtasks into one agent — fresh context per subtask is the whole point.

Brief every subagent with:

- The path to `HANDOFF.md` and an instruction to read it first as its primary context.
- Its specific subtask number and the acceptance check it must satisfy.
- The project's verification commands and guardrails (from the handoff).
- For a subtask that **edits files**: pass `isolation: "worktree"` so it works on an isolated
  copy and cannot collide with sibling agents or your working tree.
- For a **read-only** subtask (research, analysis): no worktree needed.

Dispatch independent subtasks **concurrently** (multiple Agent calls in one turn). For
subtasks with a stated dependency, wait for the prerequisite to finish, then dispatch the
dependent one — or fold the dependency into a single sequential agent if splitting would
fracture one coherent change.

Suggested brief per subagent:

> Read `HANDOFF.md` at the repo root — it is your full briefing. Execute **Next step #N**
> only. Acceptance check: `<the check>`. Honor the guardrails in the handoff's "Risks &
> guardrails" section. When done, report: files changed, the verification command output,
> and any follow-up the next agent needs.

**Failable check:** confirm the number of subagents dispatched equals the number of open
subtasks in "Next steps" (every open item is claimed by exactly one agent — nothing dropped,
nothing double-assigned).

## Stage 4 — Collect, verify, self-critique

As subagents return, record each result back into `HANDOFF.md` (move finished items from
"Next steps" to "Done" with their evidence). Then run the project's verification commands
yourself to confirm the integrated result is actually green — a subagent reporting success is
a claim, not proof.

Before declaring done, name at least one weakness: a subtask whose acceptance check was weak,
a possible interaction between two subagents' changes, or a section of the handoff that was
thinner than it should have been. Fix it or flag it to the user.

---

## Notes

- `HANDOFF.md` is a working artifact. If it should not be committed, the project may gitignore
  it — check the project's conventions before committing it as part of a change.
- The deterministic `pre-compact-handoff` hook (if installed) writes a best-effort snapshot
  before a context compaction. That snapshot is a safety net, not a substitute for this skill:
  the hook cannot reason about which work is done or delegate it. Run this skill deliberately
  while you still have context to write a good handoff.

---

## Test-driven development (mandatory)

Follow RED-first TDD: write the failing test(s) first and run them to confirm they fail for the right reason, then implement until green. Never write tests after the code. This is the failable-verification stage of smith-mode.

The handoff document MUST report test status honestly: record whether the suite is RED or green at the time of handoff, list any known failing tests by name, and include the exact test command so the receiving agent starts from a verified baseline — never assume green without running the tests.
