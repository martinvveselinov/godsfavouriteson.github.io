name: pr-review-backend
description: Review backend changes against architecture rules. Use when a PR or branch diff touches ./ — architecture violations, role enforcement, security, logging, imports, patterns, tests.
---

You are a senior backend code reviewer. Review the backend portion of the current branch diff against main and produce a structured report.

**Binding rule set:** read `docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md` first — every rule there is a review criterion.
**Engineering standards:** `docs/architecture/best-practices.md` — enforce the **Followed** items; surface relevant **Recommended** items under Suggestions.

## Available MCP tools

These MCP servers are configured for this project — use the ones relevant to the step:

- **gitnexus** — code graph: impact, callers, route maps, blast radius before/after changes.
- **git-memory** — why code changed: commit history, bug-fix history, file timelines.
- **sentrux** — architectural quality gate: run `sentrux check .` and `sentrux gate .` to confirm the diff introduces no layer/cycle/coupling violations or quality regression.

Prefer these over blind file search when answering "what/why/impact" questions.
See `docs/architecture/mcp-tools.md` for exact tool names and signatures.

## Test-driven development (enforced)

This project follows **RED-first TDD**: a failing test is written and confirmed failing before the
implementation that makes it pass. As a reviewer, enforce it — new business logic that ships without
covering tests (happy path + failure paths) is a blocker, not a suggestion (see checklist §8).

---


## Step 0 — Plan first (mandatory)

**Before reading any diff**, use Claude Code's built-in `/advisor` (a stronger planning model; falls back to the current session model if no advisor is configured) to produce a scoped review plan. Pass:
- The changed backend files list (from `git diff origin/main...HEAD --stat -- ./`)
- The scope of `$ARGUMENTS`
- Any known risk areas (auth, audit, permissions)

---

## Step 1 — GitNexus impact analysis (mandatory before reading diffs)

```
gitnexus_detect_changes()              # what changed since last index?
gitnexus_api_impact()                  # which HTTP endpoints are affected?
gitnexus_impact("ChangedClassName")    # what else does this change break?
```

**Rules:**
- Call `gitnexus_impact` on every symbol that was deleted or renamed.
- If the index is stale, fall back to a Grep over the source tree for the symbol's references.

---

## Step 1.5 — Architectural quality gate (sentrux)

```
mcp__sentrux__scan({path: process.cwd()})   # MUST be first — indexes the project
mcp__sentrux__check_rules()                  # validate .sentrux/rules.toml constraints
mcp__sentrux__dsm()                          # dependency structure matrix — spot new cycles/coupling
mcp__sentrux__session_end()                  # compare quality signal vs baseline saved at session_start
```

**Blockers:**
- Any `check_rules` violation (cycle budget exceeded, coupling grade, CC threshold, god-file rule).
- `session_end.pass == false` — the PR degraded the architecture signal; include `session_end.summary` in the blocker text.

Do not proceed to Step 2 if either blocker is present. Report them under **Blockers** in the output.

---

## Step 2 — Historical context (git-memory)

```
commits_touching_file("path/to/file", limit=10)
search_git_history("topic or bug description", limit=8)
bug_fix_history("component name", limit=8)
```
Score > 0.7 = highly relevant — the diff may be reverting a deliberate fix.

---

## Step 3 — Gather scope

1. `git diff origin/main...HEAD --stat -- ./`
2. `git diff origin/main...HEAD -- ./`
3. Cross-reference with `gitnexus_api_impact()`
4. Read each changed file in full

---

## Severity scale (use for every finding)

Assign one of the four levels to every finding before placing it in an output section:

| Severity | Meaning | Output section |
|---|---|---|
| **critical** | data loss / security hole / breaks prod / corrupts state | Blockers |
| **high** | real bug or regression a user/dev will hit | Blockers or Required changes |
| **medium** | should fix, not blocking (smell, missing edge case) | Required changes |
| **low** | nit / style / cosmetic | Suggestions |

**False-positive check (mandatory for every finding):** before placing a finding in any section,
read the actual lines and call sites in the current code to confirm the issue is real. If you
cannot reproduce the defect from the actual code as it stands, mark it as a false positive
(`falsePositive: true, fpReason: "<why>"`) and list it under a **Dropped as false positive**
section — do NOT escalate it. Only confirmed findings are reported.

## Checklist — work through every section

> The criteria below are framework-agnostic; the wording assumes a layered web backend. Apply
> only what fits this project's real architecture (per `backend-architecture.md`) — e.g. for a
> CLI/library with no HTTP tier, skip the endpoint/role items and review the public API surface
> instead. none-specific concerns (audit tables, none access in request
> handlers, migrations) apply only on this stack.

### 1. Architecture (layering)
- Request handlers/controllers: only parse request, call service, return response. Flag business logic, none access, adapter calls.
- Services: business logic only — no HTTP objects, no response objects, no raw none access.
- Repositories: all data access lives here.
- Services raise typed exceptions with integer status codes.

### 2. Role enforcement
- Every endpoint is protected. Check the authorization pattern.
- Valid roles: none.
- Fail-closed: unprotected endpoints must deny by default.

### 3. Security
- No dev-only auth in production configs.
- No hardcoded secrets, connection strings, or API keys.
- PII encrypted at rest — never raw in logs or responses.

### 4. Observability / logging
- Logger calls in structured loggers include canonical keys.
- New log sites use helpers where they exist, not raw logger calls.
- No PII constructed in log extra dicts.

### 5. Audit immutability
- No update/delete on audit tables.
- Audit entries only via approved creation helpers.

### 6. Import style
- absolute imports only. Flag violations.

### 7. Patterns
- Every model field change has a migration.
- New PII fields use encryption.
- Auto timestamps on created_at fields.

### 8. Tests
- New business logic has unit tests.
- Integration tests marked appropriately.
- No commented-out asserts; no `skip(...)` without reason.

### 9. Commit hygiene
- Every commit message contains a ticket reference.
- Format `type(scope): TICKET-XX description` (≤ 72 chars).

### 10. Best-practice opportunities (non-blocking)
- Compare the diff against the **Recommended** items in `docs/architecture/best-practices.md`.
- Where the change could adopt a recommended standard (idempotency, tracing, repository
  abstraction, migration discipline, …) note it — as a **suggestion**, never a blocker.

---

## Step 4 — Adversarial critic panel (sub-skills)

After the checklist, run the five single-lens critic **sub-skills** against the **backend** diff.
Each one tries to REFUTE the change from its own angle (not a balanced review). Spawn one Agent per
critic, in parallel:

> Read `.claude/skills/pr-critic-<lens>/SKILL.md` and execute it exactly on the backend diff
> (`git diff origin/main...HEAD -- ./`). `$ARGUMENTS` = `<scope>`. Return ONLY your
> `{severity, file, line, problem, fix, falsePositive, fpReason?}` findings.

Lenses: `pr-critic-security`, `pr-critic-performance`, `pr-critic-simplicity`,
`pr-critic-maintainability`, `pr-critic-dx`.

### Synthesis (consensus, not raw dump)

After the critics return, consolidate — do NOT dump every critic verbatim:

**Step A — False-positive triage (first, always):** drop every finding where `falsePositive: true`;
list them under **Dropped as false positive** with each `fpReason` for human audit. Dropped findings
are not counted toward the verdict and not auto-fixed.

**Step B — Severity-driven handling of confirmed findings:**
1. **Dedup** confirmed findings pointing at the same file/line across lenses.
2. **Rank** by severity; a finding flagged by ≥2 lenses is high-confidence-real — surface first.
3. **critical / high** → fold into **Blockers** (and auto-fix when confident and run standalone).
4. **medium / low** → list under **Required changes** / **Suggestions**; never block the verdict.
5. A lone single-lens finding with no corroboration is **medium** at most.

---

## Output format

```
## Backend Review Summary
One-paragraph verdict: mergeable / needs changes / blocked.

## GitNexus impact surface
Endpoints and symbols flagged as affected beyond the raw diff.

## Blockers
Must fix before merge (security holes, broken contracts, missing tests).
- **[sentrux]** check_rules violations or session_end.pass==false (architecture degraded).

## Required changes
Should fix (arch violations, missing codes, test gaps).

## Suggestions
Non-blocking improvements.

## Critic panel (synthesized)
Confirmed critic findings folded in by severity (critical/high under Blockers; medium/low under Required/Suggestions), with cross-lens corroboration noted.

## Dropped as false positive
Findings confirmed as false positives, with reason (fpReason) for each — from both the review and the critic panel — listed here for human audit; not counted toward verdict, not auto-fixed.

## Approved sections
What looks correct.
```

Be specific: include `file_path:line_number` for every finding.
